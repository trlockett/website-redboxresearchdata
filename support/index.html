				<h2>ReDBox Support</h2>
			</header>
			<h3 id="redbox-is-open-source">ReDBox is Open Source</h3>
<p> QCIF is proud to say that the ReDBox and Mint platforms are both Open Source software, making them freely available for anyone to download, install and use. This means that while QCIF manages the development of these platforms, we keep everything as transparent as possible. We rely upon the interaction of our community to prioritise new features and participate in the development and testing of the release cycles. It also means that any development performed for a specific client will be contributed back to the code base to the benefit of all (see Project Services).</p>
<h3 id="community-support">Community Support</h3>
<p> The ReDBox and Mint systems are both open-source and you are free to download and install the systems as you please.</p>
<p>Community support is available through:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/redbox-repo">Our mailing list</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.redboxresearchdata.com.au/documentation">Documentation on this site</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qcif-support-agreements">QCIF Support Agreements</h3>

<li>Access to QCIF&#39;s online support system through which to lodge support requests</li>
